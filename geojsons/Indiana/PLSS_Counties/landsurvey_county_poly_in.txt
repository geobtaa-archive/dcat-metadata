  Description:
    Abstract:
      LANDSURVEY_COUNTY_POLY_IN is a 1:24,000-scale polygon
      shapefile with a projection of Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
      North American Datum (NAD) 1983 zone 16.
    Purpose:
      This shapefile was created as a framework layer defining the
      county boundaries of Indiana in polygon format.  The information is
      intended for geographic display or analysis at a scale of 1:24,000 or
      smaller.
    Supplemental_Information:
      This shapefile was derived from a predecessor coverage named "IN_LANDSURVEY."  IN_LANDSURVEY is a
      digital representation of land survey features as represented on the USGS 1:24,000 digital raster
      graphic (DRG) series. ESRI ArcEdit 8.1 and ESRI ArcView 3.2 were used to extract the following shapefiles
      from IN_LANDSURVEY:
      LANDSURVEY_COUNTY_LINE_IN, LANDSURVEY_COUNTY_POLY_IN, LANDSURVEY_SECTIONS_LINE_IN, LANDSURVEY_SECTIONS_POLY_IN,
      LANDSURVEY_STATE_LINE_IN, LANDSURVEY_STATE_POLY_IN, LANDSURVEY_TOWNSHIPS_LINE_IN, and LANDSURVEY_TOWNSHIPS_POLY_IN.

      NOTE -- This shapefile is identical to a version named "INDIANA_COUNTYBDY_24K_IGS_P".
      This metadata file is a copy of the metadata for "INDIANA_COUNTYBDY_24K_IGS_P" that has had minor edits.
      The shapefile and metadata were renamed to conform to a file-naming convention for a project funded
      outside the IGS.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      All county names contained in the fields
      named "NAME_U" and "NAME_L" were checked against the USGS
      7.5-minute quadrangles. The prefix code contained in the field
      named "NCAPC" was checked against the AccessIndiana Indiana Bureau
      of Motor Vehicles license plates and titles county prefixes listed on license plates.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    A check was made for dangling nodes and none
    were detected.
  Completeness_Report:
    A check was made to verify that the county boundaries
    are continuous and are identical to the county boundaries contained in IN_LANDSURVEY.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Accuracy is no better than that
        of the source material used to compile IN_LANDSURVEY.  The vector lines contained
        in IN_LANDSURVEY were corrected to DRG raster lines at an on-screen scale of 1:5,000 or
        better.
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Vertical accuracy was not a factor
        in the digital production of the data set.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        IN_LANDSURVEY was opened in ESRI ArcEdit
        and queried for layer_1 = "CO-BDY" or layer_1 = "CO-BDY-CLOSE" or
        layer_2 = "CO-BDY." A resulting coverage was constructed and the fields
        Name_U, Name_L, and NCAPC were added.

        The Name_U field was populated with the county name in all capital
        letters as spelled on the USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles.  The Name_L
        field was populated with the county names in mixed upper and lower
        case letters as defined by the IGS standard.  The NCAPC field was
        populated with the numeric county alphabetical prefix codes defined
        on license plates as listed on the Indiana Bureau of Motors Vehicles
        web page. The resulting coverage was then opened in ESRI ArcView and saved
        as a shapefile named "INDIANA_COUNTYBDY_24K_IGS_P."
