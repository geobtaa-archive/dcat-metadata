Specifically, this data serves as a resource for cartographic output and spatial analysis.<br /><br />This layer is a spatial representation of specific patches of natural vegetation within larger intact landscapes that have the potential to harbor high quality natural communities and/or for harboring rare plants and animals. These patches represent places on the landscape that appear to have experienced the least amount of impact or degradation from human activities since the early 1800s.<br /><br />These potential natural areas (PNAs) represent patches of various natural land cover that also vary in size, quality, and landscape context. The natural land cover types within these PNAs also vary by type and quality. The objective is to identify specific patches of natural land cover (forest, wetland) within priority PNAs, that have a high likelihood of exhibiting ecological intactness and integrity.<br /><br />The polygons contained in this feature class were derived from data developed for the Oakland County Potential Natural Areas Assessment: 2017 Report. Oakland County's digital aerial photography from 1940, 1963, and 2015 along with the Oakland County NaturalArea2017 coverage were the primary data sources used to create this data.  Key attributes include Habitat and Notes.<br /><br />The term &quot;potential natural area&quot; is not to be confused with the legal term &quot;dedicated Natural Area&quot; as described in Part 351, Wilderness and Natural Areas, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act of 1994 which gives land special legal protection.<br /><br />For more detailed information, please view the Oakland County Potential Natural Areas Assessment: 2017 Report prepared by: John Paskus, Associate Program Leader - Conservation Helen Enander, Information Technologist I Michigan Natural Features Inventory P.O. Box 13036, Lansing, MI 48901 (Report Number 2017-17) at <a href='https://www.oakgov.com/it/gis/Documents/metadata/Oakland_2017_PNA_Final_Report.pdf' target='_blank'>https://www.oakgov.com/it/gis/Documents/metadata/Oakland_2017_PNA_Final_Report.pdf</a>. This document provides essential information for the attributes and procedures used to create the features in the dataset.<br /><br />The purpose of this assessment was to delineate the highest quality patches of natural land cover within high scoring potential natural areas (PNAs) that demonstrate the greatest opportunity for conservation value. Conservation value can be defined by a number of different factors, such as: the presence of rare and declining species, high plant and/or animal species diversity, structural diversity, presence of biological legacies such as large dead and downed trees, intact ecological processes, intact hydrology, and/or lack of key threats. The problem is that all of these factors are almost impossible to detect from aerial imagery, and almost always require field inspection.<br /><br />However, understanding that there are limitations with remote analysis, this assessment was based on aerial imagery from several different time periods: 1940, 1963 and 2015. The earliest time period available for aerial imagery of Oakland County was from the 1940. As with most of the Lower Peninsula, Oakland County had been significantly altered by European settler activities by the turn of the 20th century. This is the best representation of patches of forests and wetlands that appear to still be intact almost 80 years ago. A key habitat type that is missing from this landscape analysis is grassland. Unfortunately, native grassland systems such as prairie, savanna, and barrens, were virtually eliminated by the early 1900s throughout Michigan, and the remaining small, isolated patches of native grassland are essentially impossible to identify from old, low quality, black and white aerial photographs.<br /><br />Due to the fact that there were not enough funds or resources to delineate and characterize every patch of natural land cover within every PNA, the first step in the process was to identify PNAs with the highest potential for conserving ecological value. That was determined by three key factors: 1) PNA total scores (with enhanced criteria), 2) percentage of private land (higher the better), and 3) proximity to public land (closer the better). First, all enhanced criteria total scores greater than 15 were identified. From that selection, PNAs with greater than fifty percent private ownership were selected. This was determined using the Oakland County 2015 conservation lands database. These were placed in the first priority category for natural community assessment. Once those were selected, PNAs adjacent to or in close proximity to publically owned lands were the first to be evaluated for high quality natural land cover. There were a total of 70 first priority PNAs. Once these were assessed, a second set of PNAs were identified. Although these PNAs also had high total scores (based on the enhanced criteria), they also had a higher percentage of public land; in some cases they were 100 percent publically owned. A key factor for prioritization was the amount of privately owned land (the higher the better), and whether or not the area had been surveyed within the past 20 years. The majority of the highest ranking second priority PNAs had some form of regional or local public ownership (as opposed to state ownership, such as state park and recreation areas). A total of 18 second priority PNAs was identified.<br /><br />Once the priority PNAs were identified, the next step in the process was to determine which patches of natural land cover within these PNAs, had a high probability of still being in good condition. This was done by identifying all natural land cover patches from the 1940 aerial photographs. Once these patches were identified, the next step was to eliminate all portions of these patches that demonstrated major alterations based on the 1963 aerial photographs. In addition, forest patches or portions of forest patches that did not show up as forest on the digital USGS quadrangle topographic maps were also removed. All remaining patches of habitat were considered high quality, and delineated using heads up digitizing. They were also attributed with primary land cover type, size, and notes. Primary land cover types used for this analysis included: 1) lowland deciduous forest, 2) lowland mixed forest, 3) lowland conifer forest, 4) non-forested wetland, 5) mixed wetland complex, and 6) upland forest. These cover types were chosen because of the high confidence levels for delineating each type in this portion of Michigan\u2019s Lower Peninsula. If an MNFI Scientist was able to identify more specific natural community types based on topography, soils, hydrology, aspect distinct aerial imagery signature, or other factors, that information was also included in the notes field of the database.<br /><br /><br />Reference Reports:<br /><br />Shiawassee &amp; Huron Headwaters Resource Preservation Project - March 2000 Project Staff: Carlisle Wortman &amp; Associates - Richard Carlisle, PCP, and Carey Nyberg Land Information Access Association - Joe VanderMeulen Michigan Natural Features Inventory - John Paskus Oakland County Planning &amp; Economic Development Services - Bret C.

Each feature was assigned a priority classification of One, Two, or Three. Key attributes include Priority, EnhancedPriority and TotalScore. &quot;Priority&quot; and &quot;EnhanedPriority&quot; are a reflection of quality and an indication of the level of priority to retain or conserve the natural state of the identified area.</span></p><p><span>The term &quot;potential natural area&quot; is not to be confused with the legal term &quot;dedicated Natural Area&quot; as described in Part 351, Wilderness and Natural Areas, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act of 1994 which gives land special legal protection.</span></p><p><span>The Oakland County Potential Natural Areas Assessment: 2017 Report prepared by: John Paskus, Associate Program Leader - Conservation Helen Enander, Information Technologist I Michigan Natural Features Inventory P.O.

Box 30444 8th Floor, Mason Bldg. Lansing, MI 48909-7944 <br /><br />This\n report identifies and ranks Potential Natural Areas remaining in \nOakland County. Potential Natural Areas are defined as places on the \nlandscape dominated by native vegetation that have various levels of \npotential for harboring high quality natural areas and unique natural \nfeatures. In addition these areas may provide critical ecological \nservices such as maintaining water quality and quantity, soil \ndevelopment and stabilization, pollination of cropland, wildlife travel \ncorridors, stopover sites for migratory birds, sources of genetic \ndiversity, and floodwater retention. However, the actual ecological \nvalue of these areas can only be truly ascertained through on the ground\n biological surveys. The process established by the Michigan Natural \nFeatures Inventory (MNFI) of identifying potential conservation areas \ncan also be used to update and track the status of these remaining \nsites. The site map and ranking data can be used by local \nmunicipalities, land trusts, and other agencies to prioritize \nconservation efforts and assist in finding opportunities to establish an\n open space system of linked natural areas throughout Oakland County. <br /><br />In\n this report the term &quot;potential natural area&quot; has been used in place of\n the term &quot;potential conservation area&quot;. The substitution was made in \norder to convey to the reader a clearer picture of the type of sites \nthat are being delineated. It is felt that more people have a better \nunderstanding of the term &quot;natural area&quot;. The term &quot;potential natural \narea&quot;, however, is not to be confused with the legal term &quot;dedicated \nNatural Area&quot; as described in Part 351, Wilderness and Natural Areas, of\n the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act of 1994 which \ngives land special legal protection.<br /><br />When using this information \nit is important to keep in mind that site boundaries and ranking are a \nstarting point and tend to be somewhat general in nature. Consequently, \neach community, group or individual using this information should \ndetermine what additional expertise is needed in order to establish more\n exact boundaries and the most appropriate conservation efforts. <br /><br /><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Materials and Interpretation Methodology: </span><br />Interpretation\n of the 25-township area in Oakland County was conducted by using \ndigital aerial photography taken in 2002, Tax Parcel, and 2002 Oakland \nCounty Potential Conservation/Natural Areas provided by Oakland County's\n Planning and Economic Development Services Division. <br /><br />As the \ntownships were methodically interpreted and digitized using this \nimagery, the same areas were examined using: Southeast Michigan Council \nof Governments (SEMCOG) 2000 digital landcover, Michigan Center for \nGeographic Information (MCGI) MI Geographic Framework Hydrography (v3b),\n and Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) Biotics Database. These \nadditional data sources were used to enhance and corroborate the \ninterpretation process. <br /><br />Delineation of sites was done through \naerial photo interpretation, with emphasis placed on 1) intactness, 2) \nwetlands and wetland complexes, 3) riparian corridors, and 4) forested \ntracts. Delineation of sites during this phase of the process was done \nconservatively, such that the chance of capturing sites that may end up \nbeing eliminated upon closer inspection, was greater than the chance of \nomitting sites that should have been delineated. Sites were delineated \nby focusing on wetlands and forest tracts and eliminating as much \ndevelopment (including roads), active agriculture and old fields as \npossible. Boundaries typically were defined by hard edges such as roads,\n parking lots, developments, and railroad beds. All potential natural \nareas were identified and delineated regardless of size. Municipal \nboundaries were not utilized to delineate site boundaries unless the \nboundary corresponded to a defined hard edge, such as a road. Once all \nsites were delineated, sites under 20 acres were deleted. <br /><br />Following\n the aerial photo interpretation and the delineation of potential \nnatural areas, a more rigorous level of examination was undertaken based\n upon specific scaled criteria to prioritize sites. The criteria used to\n first delineate the sites were translated to a numerical scale. Each \nsite could then be assessed based upon the scaled criteria and a total \ncalculated score, based upon the sum of the scores for each criterion.", "license": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0/license.json", "title": "OC 2004 MNFI Potential Natural Areas", "issued": "2016-10-16T18:55:49.000Z", "accessLevel": "public", "modified": "2016-11-07T17:56:14.000Z", "theme": ["geospatial"], "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0", "mediaType": "text/html", "format": "Web Page", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset"}, {"accessURL": "https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseNaturalFeaturesMapService/MapServer/0", "mediaType": "application/json", "format": "Esri REST", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Esri Rest API"}, {"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0.geojson", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "format": "GeoJSON", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON"}, {"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0.csv", "mediaType": "text/csv", "format": "CSV", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV"}, {"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0.kml", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "format": "KML", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML"}, {"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0.zip", "mediaType": "application/zip", "format": "ZIP", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile"}], "keyword": ["natural features", "natural areas", "MNFI", "environment", "Conservation", "planning", "green space", "green belt", "Open Space Planning", "open space", "endangered species", "preservation"], "spatial": "-83.6941,42.4263,-83.0845,42.8924", "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "OCAGOAdmin"}, "landingPage": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0", "@type": "dcat:Dataset"}, {"publisher": {"source": "Oakland County, Michigan"}, "identifier": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/bd1890488c344537bea50eb2faf8ab80_0", "description": "BY USING THIS WEBSITE OR THE CONTENT THEREIN, YOU AGREE TO THE\u00a0<u><a href='https://www.oakgov.com/open-data-terms'>TERMS OF USE</a></u><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>.\u00a0</span><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir LT W01 35 Light&quot;,&quot;Avenir Next&quot;,&quot;Avenir&quot;,&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;,&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;'><br /></span></span>Growers can determine which plants are most likely to thrive at a location.

Polygons were delineated on a hard-copy map by John Zawiskie, Cranbrook geologist. The map was then scanned and registered to Oakland County GIS data. The polygons were digitized on-screen.

Prior work by Farrand and Bell (1982) mapped surficial geology deposits of the entire state; however the data is too coarse to have meaningful application at a county and sub-County scale. An improved data set was created by combining Oakland's detailed digital topography with a more detailed geology map. Secondary business purposes include natural resources planning and environmental analysis. For example, this map was used to create an aquifer vulnerability map analysis as part of a countywide water resources study conducted by the United States Geological Survey.</span><br /><br /><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>These features were captured using a combination of a surface TIN derived from 10-foot contours and a detailed original map of Oakland County surficial geology by Twenter and Knutilla, 1972.

The polygons contained in this \nfeature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature \nclass. Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has \nmultiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. <br /><br />Assessing \nrecords and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute \neach tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in \n2015. <br /><br />Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell \nnumber). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The \nKey Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link \nthe parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in \nOakland County Land Records.<br /><br />The 2015 version of land use was \ncreated using the 2014 version as a primary source. It was assumed that \nif the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both \nyears, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a \nchange occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of \nthe land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually \nchecked again for this update to enusre the assigned use is still \naccurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and\n Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented \nparcels. <br /><br />The development process consists of three basic steps. \nFirst, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single \nland use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that \nis assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified \nusing orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax \nparcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single \nland use dataset. <br /><br />Assumptions: <br />In 2005, Oakland County \nEqualization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the\n use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were \ninterpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major\n change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the &quot;ME,\n Miscellaneous Exempt&quot; use code, but are instead usually classifed as \n&quot;RV, Residential Vacant.&quot; The &quot;Taxable&quot; field was referenced to locate \ntax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned \nproperty during this land use update. <br /><br />Any parcel classified as \nvacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved \nparcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of \nthe adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, \nhowever, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a\n single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption. <br /><br />Parcels\n with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be \nreclassified as Vacant or Recreation &amp; Conservation (due to \nsubdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries\n are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open \nspace. The following strings are queried from the Owner1 and Owner2 \nfields: &quot;*own*&quot; (unknown, homeowner), &quot;ass*&quot; (association, ass'n, etc), \nand &quot;park.&quot; <br /><br />The Equalization use code BI, Business Improved \nincludes uses that are reclassified as Commercial/Office. Uses may also \nfall into Public/Institutional, however, all BI parcels are not manually\n checked for reclassification. <br /><br />The Equalization use code MM, \nMiscellaneous Business includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation\n and Conservation, Multiple Family, Commercial/Office, or Mobile Home \nPark. <br /><br />The Equalization use code ME, Miscellaneous Exempt \nincludes uses that are reclassified as Recreation &amp; Conservation, \nPublic/Institutional, Transportation, Utility &amp; Communication, \nIndustrial (municipal landfills), or any Single Family classification. <br /><br />The\n Equalization use code KI, Condominium Improved includes uses that are \nreclassified as Multiple Family, Single Family, or Commercial/Office. \nAny parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, \nFarm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use. <br /><br />Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use. <br /><br />Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use. <br /><br />Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use. <br /><br />Any\n parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is \nconsidered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related \nuse. <br /><br />Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant. <br /><br />Any\n parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may\n be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation &amp; Conservation, (golf \ncourses) or Industrial (mining or extractive). <br /><br />Polygons in the \nROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and \nConservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.\n <br /><br />Because of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and \nthe goal of creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its \nmetadata, there may be exceptions from these assumptions.<br /><br />Exceptions: <br />There\n are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously \noverstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.

The \nspatial accuracy and number of vertices used to represent each feature \nwas limited by the intended purpose of the data.\n\n<br /><br />The land use features were heads-up digitized from a 1966 land \nuse map that was scanned and georefereneced using each section corner as\n a control point.  The features were digitized at a scale not greater \nthan 1:15,000, one square-mile section at a time.  After the entire \ncounty was completely digitized, the features were dissolved based on \nthe Landuse.\n\n<br /><br />Right-of-Way was burned in to the final feature class using the \nfollowing process.  First, the current RoadCenterline feature class was \nmodifed to reflect roads in 1966 using the scanned 1966 land use map and\n 1963 orthophotography as a reference.  Next, the road lines were \nbuffered at specified distanced based on the RoadCode attribute from \nRoadCenterline to create polygons.  Major Roads were split into two \ntypes (Perscriptive Easement and Dedicated) based on if the adjacent \nproperty was platted prior to 1966.  According to the Oakland County \nRegister of Deeds, in 1966 Oakland County was recording documents in \nliber 120.  For the purpose of this feature class it was assumed that \nsimultaneous conveyances recorded in liber 120 or earlier existed in \n1966.

When no tax billing code was available (for communities that don't use the county's assessing system), the community was contacted to obtain the base year. When two separate authorities overlap, each authority can establish overlapping development areas. The authority that first created the development area has first claim on tax increment financing capture.\u00a0</span><br /><br /><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Authority boundaries are represented using multiple features when the development area is not coincident with the authority boundary. One feature represents the development area and a second feature represents the remainder of the authority district that is not part of the development area. Multiple features are also used to represent authorities that have multiple development areas or development areas that have multiple base years.\u00a0</span><br /><br /><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Brownfield Redevelopment Authorities are unique in that the authority boundaries are generally defined as the entire municipality. For this reason, the non-development areas of BRA's have been excluded from this data. The following list shows communities in Oakland County that have established a BRA: City of Auburn Hills City of Birmingham City of Farmington City of Farmington Hills City of Ferndale City of Hazel Park Charter Township of Highland Village of Holly City of Madison Heights Village of Milford County of Oakland City of Oak Park City of Pontiac City of Rochester City of Rochester Hills Charter Twp of Royal Oak City of Royal Oak City of Southfield City of Troy Charter Township of Waterford\u00a0</span><br /><br /><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Source documents for the boundary of each feature were obtained from the State of Michigan Office of the Great Seal, Oakland County Equalization, and the Oakland County Treasurer's office. These could be in the form of a legal description, parcel list, and/or map.\u00a0</span><br /><br /><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>For several boundaries, multiple sources were available and conflicted with each other. When this occurred, hierarchy was given to the legal description, then a parcel list, over the map, and the conflict is noted in the Comments field. However, if a parcel was shown in a parcel list, but not described in the authority based on the legal description, then it was still shown in the authority.</span><br /><br /><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>It should also be noted that legal descriptions were not digitized using exact coordinate geometry. Instead, features were created by referencing the legal description to snap vertices to parcels, right-of-way, section corners, subdivisions, and lots. Features digitized from a legal description or map included road and railroad rights-of-way as it was described or shown in the document.</span><br /><br /><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>For vague legal descriptions and parcel lists, right-of-way was addressed uniquely for each authority. Some source documents had statements that all or half of the surrounding right-of-way is to be included in the boundary, but some did not address right-of-way at all. In these cases, right-of-way was addressed distinctly for each authority based on the type of authority and the source documents with the method used recorded in the Comments field.\u00a0</span><br /><br /><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>The data will be updated on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis when authorities amend their development plans or new authorities are established. Oakland County Equalization and the Oakland County Treasurer's Office will notify and forward the source documents of necessary revisions to Oakland County Planning and Economic Development Services who is the custodian of the feature class. Communities will be contacted annually to verify that the districts have not changed without the knowledge of county departments. In particular, county departments may not be aware of BRA development projects when no TIF is captured. Lastly, because the tax parcel feature class is revised periodically and it is important for the features to be coincident with the tax parcel feature class, the development authority feature class will also be updated annually to correct conflicts due to parcel shifting.</span></div>", "license": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/e90026448daa4d568daa3ef727d8d758_2/license.json", "title": "OC Development Authority", "issued": "2016-10-16T17:43:51.000Z", "accessLevel": "public", "modified": "2016-11-02T15:15:28.000Z", "theme": ["geospatial"], "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/e90026448daa4d568daa3ef727d8d758_2", "mediaType": "text/html", "format": "Web Page", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset"}, {"accessURL": "https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseOpenPlanningMapService/MapServer/2", "mediaType": "application/json", "format": "Esri REST", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Esri Rest API"}, {"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/e90026448daa4d568daa3ef727d8d758_2.geojson", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "format": "GeoJSON", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON"}, {"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/e90026448daa4d568daa3ef727d8d758_2.csv", "mediaType": "text/csv", "format": "CSV", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV"}, {"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/e90026448daa4d568daa3ef727d8d758_2.kml", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "format": "KML", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML"}, {"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/e90026448daa4d568daa3ef727d8d758_2.zip", "mediaType": "application/zip", "format": "ZIP", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile"}], "keyword": ["development authority", "planning", "TIF", "tax increment financing", "brownfield", "special tax district", "downtown development authority", "DDA", "TIFA", "corridor improvement authority", "CIA", "economic"], "spatial": "-83.6709,42.4325,-83.075,42.8589", "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "OCAGOAdmin"}, "landingPage": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/e90026448daa4d568daa3ef727d8d758_2", "@type": "dcat:Dataset"}, {"publisher": {"source": "Oakland County, Michigan"}, "identifier": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/49f14754ca4742849e4f060301fa811f_0", "description": "<div>BY USING THIS WEBSITE OR THE CONTENT THEREIN, YOU AGREE TO THE\u00a0<u><a href='https://www.oakgov.com/open-data-terms'>TERMS OF USE</a></u><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>.\u00a0</span></div><div><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Created for the January 2016 Map of the Month.

A digital orthoimage is a raster\nimage processed from vertical aerial images in which displacement in the image\ndue to sensor orientation and terrain relief have been removed. Orthoimagery\ncombines the image characteristics of an image with the geometric qualities of\na map. Unlike planimetric maps which depict natural and manmade features by\nmeans of lines, point symbols, texts and polygons, orthoimagery illustrates the\nactual images of features and are thus more easily interpreted than regular\nmaps. The normal orientation of data in an orthoimage is by lines (rows) and\nsamples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to\neast with the order of the lines from north to south. Each image tile is stored\nin industry standard TIFF (tagged interchange file format) with an associated\nTIFF world file. Aerial imagery was acquired between April 12 and 15 2015 from\nflying heights of approximately 1400-1640 feet above ground level (AGL). Each\northoimage tile is 2500feet X 2500feet in dimension, edge-tied with the\nadjacent tiles (no gap and no overlap). This dataset is published in\nNAD_1983_HARN_StatePlane_Michigan_South_FIPS_2111_Feet_Intl_feet.</span>", "license": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/9d32404d1eb84978b5a8a0c43ff698fd/license.json", "title": "WhiteLake2015", "issued": "2016-12-12T17:24:33.000Z", "accessLevel": "public", "modified": "2018-08-06T15:15:23.000Z", "theme": ["geospatial"], "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/9d32404d1eb84978b5a8a0c43ff698fd", "mediaType": "text/html", "format": "Web Page", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset"}, {"accessURL": "https://ocgispublic.s3.amazonaws.com/Imagery2015/WhiteLake2015.zip", "mediaType": "application/json", "format": "Esri REST", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Esri Rest API"}], "keyword": ["Imagery", "orthos", "mrsid"], "spatial": "-83.773,42.5476,-83.1399,42.8348", "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "OCAGOAdmin"}, "landingPage": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/9d32404d1eb84978b5a8a0c43ff698fd", "@type": "dcat:Dataset"}, {"publisher": {"source": "Oakland County, Michigan"}, "identifier": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/6105a64b85624b2da027eded3481dd05", "description": "<div>BY USING THIS WEBSITE OR THE CONTENT THEREIN, YOU AGREE TO THE\u00a0<u><a href='https://www.oakgov.com/open-data-terms'>TERMS OF USE</a></u><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>.</span></div><div><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'><br /></span></div><div><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Tornado paths and starting/touchdown points in Oakland County, Michigan circa 1953-2015.

It is the story of how the people of Oakland County responded   collectively and individually to one of the most perilous times in our   nation's history. It is about how 10 percent of its populace would volunteer   to fight for the rights and freedom of others, but it is also about the 90   percent who supported this effort from the home front; the shared sacrifices   collectively borne by the families of those who enlisted. It is about how   citizens collectively supported one another and their soldiers. These are but   a few examples of the rich heritage of Oakland County and her people that   awaits you. We encourage you to use the map to locate those special places   that can connect you with this history and to embark on your own exploration   of the Civil War and the history that is uniquely Oakland County.
