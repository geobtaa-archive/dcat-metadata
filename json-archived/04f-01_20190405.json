Therefore, MPOs must devise their own methods for ensuring that EJ issues are investigated and evaluated in transportation decision-making. In 2001, DVRPC developed an EJ technical assessment to identify direct and disparate impacts of its plans, programs, and planning process on defined population groups in the Delaware Valley region. This assessment, called the Indicators of Potential Disadvantage Methodology, is utilized in a variety of DVRPC plans and programs. DVRPC currently assesses the following population groups, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau:</p>\n<p>Youth</p>\n<p>Older Adults</p>\n<p>Female</p>\n<p>Racial Minority</p>\n<p>Ethnic Minority</p>\n<p>Foreign Born</p>\n<p>Disabled</p>\n<p>Limited English Proficiency</p>\n<p>Low-Income</p>\n<p>Census tables used to gather data from the 2012 - 2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates</p>\n<p>Using U.S. Census American Community Survey data, the population groups listed above are identified and located at the census tract level. Data is gathered at the regional level, combining populations from each of the nine counties, for either individuals or households, depending on the indicator. From there, the total number of persons in each demographic group is divided by the appropriate universe (either population or households) for the nine-county region, providing a regional average for that population group. Any census tract that meets or exceeds the regional average level, or threshold, is considered an EJ-sensitive tract for that group.</p>\n<p>Census tables used to gather data from the 2012 - 2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates</p>\n<p>For more information and for methodology, visit DVRPC's website:http://www.dvrpc.org/GetInvolved/TitleVI/</p>\n<p>Source of tract boundaries: US Census Bureau.

Zonal percentile statistics were also calculated on buffered features for each raster to obtain the 90th percentile building heights (HEIGHT_ESTIMATE field).</p><p>All output statistics fields were joined to the original input feature class (with unit conversions applied, where necessary).</p><p>A complete dataset, which includes the following fields that are populated with various statistical outputs generated during the building height estimation process, is available upon request:</p><p>HEIGHT_PCT90 \u2013 90th percentile value of all cells in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.</p><p>HEIGHT_PCT50 \u2013 median value of all cells in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.</p><p>HEIGHT_COUNT \u2013 total number of cells with tabulated values in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.</p><p>SLOPE_MEAN \u2013 average of all cells in the slope raster located within the building footprint.</p><p>SLOPE_STD \u2013 standard deviation of all cells in the slope raster located within the building footprint.</p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\np.p1 {margin: 5.0px 0.0px 5.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px 'Times New Roman'}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>SLOPE_COUNT - total number of cells with tabulated values in the slope raster located within the building footprint.</p>", "keyword": ["DVRPC", "Pennsylvania", "Bucks County", "Impervious Surface", "Structures", "Building Footprints", "Building Heights", "Buildings", "Roads", "Driveways", "Parking Lots", "Sidewalks", "Planning"], "title": "DVRPC 2015 Impervious Surface - Bucks County, PA", "issued": "2017-04-05T20:48:13.000Z", "modified": "2019-03-31T12:24:18.058Z", "theme": ["geospatial"], "landingPage": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ff98ecc2dd8446cba7df3fe141735441_0", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ff98ecc2dd8446cba7df3fe141735441_0", "mediaType": "text/html", "format": "Web page", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Open Dataset"}, {"accessURL": "https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/arcgis/rest/services/Structures/BucksCo_Impervious/FeatureServer/0", "mediaType": "application/json", "format": "Esri REST", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Esri Rest API"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ff98ecc2dd8446cba7df3fe141735441_0.geojson", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "format": "GeoJSON", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ff98ecc2dd8446cba7df3fe141735441_0.csv", "mediaType": "text/csv", "format": "CSV", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ff98ecc2dd8446cba7df3fe141735441_0.kml", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "format": "KML", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ff98ecc2dd8446cba7df3fe141735441_0.zip", "mediaType": "application/zip", "format": "ZIP", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile"}], "spatial": "-75.4955,40.0468,-74.7093,40.6136", "license": "https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/ff98ecc2dd8446cba7df3fe141735441_0/license", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:wstevens@dvrpc.org", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "DVRPC MPO"}, "identifier": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ff98ecc2dd8446cba7df3fe141735441_0", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "webService": "https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/arcgis/rest/services/Structures/BucksCo_Impervious/FeatureServer/0"}, {"publisher": {"name": "DVRPC-GIS"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "<p>The Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) is the regionally agreed-upon list of priority transportation projects, as required by federal law (ISTEA, TEA-21, SAFETEA LU, MAP-21, and the FAST Act).

Centers provide a focal point in the regional landscape that recognizes the regional and local significance of places, while reinforcing a sense of community for local residents. Centers serve as a basis for organizing and focusing the development landscape and provide a framework for the most efficient provision of supportive infrastructure systems, including water, sewer, and transportation. By concentrating growth around and within Centers, the region can both preserve open space and reduce infrastructure costs. The densities and mixed uses inherent within Centers can enhance the feasibility of walking, bicycling, and public transit as alternatives to the automobile. Connections 2040identifies a hierarchy of seven Center types, shown on the Planning Areas and Centers map, based on their role and activities within the region.</p><p><br /></p><p></p><p>METROPOLITAN CENTER</p><p>Center City/University City/Camden Central Business District \u2014 spanning the Delaware River and bounded roughly by 40th Street from Girard to Washington avenues in Philadelphia and by the Ben Franklin Bridge and Interstate 676 to Clinton Street in Camden \u2014 is identified as the region\u2019s Metropolitan Center. This dense, compact, mixed-use area includes the central business districts of Philadelphia and Camden, major academic and medical institutions, and major tourist and entertainment destinations.</p><p><br /></p><p></p><p>METROPOLITAN SUBCENTERS</p><p>The Plan also identifies six Metropolitan Subcenters, reflecting their magnitude of jobs and commercial activity. These include the downtown area of Trenton and the destinations of King of Prussia/Valley Forge (Montgomery and Chester counties); International Airport (Delaware and Philadelphia counties), Navy Yard/Sports Complex (Philadelphia); Cherry Hill/Mount Laurel/Marlton (Burlington and Camden counties); and the Route 1 Corridor (Mercer County).</p><p><br /></p><p></p><p>NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERS</p><p>Connections 2040recognizes that each of the region\u2019s Core Cities is a collection of diverse neighborhoods with varying characteristics, assets, challenges, and needs, and that specific approaches and strategies for improving and revitalizing these neighborhoods will differ. The planning policies within the Core Cities and their neighborhoods focus on redevelopment and revitalization through targeted investment and reinvestment. Embedded within the region\u2019s Core Cities of Philadelphia, Trenton, Camden, and Chester are Neighborhood Centers, which are recognizable places with a mix of commercial, retail, anchor institutional, and residential activities. Neighborhood Centers have an identifiable main street or focal point, are walkable, and have a unique history or sense of a community within the larger city setting. </p><p>In addition to the metropolitan center, metropolitan subcenters, and neighborhood centers, the Plan identifies four other types of Centers: Suburban Centers, Town Centers, Rural Centers, and Planned Centers. The characteristics of each type are as follows:</p><p><br /></p><p></p><p>SUBURBAN CENTERS</p><p>Are regionally significant; While not necessarily single municipalities, are perceived as single \u201cplaces;\u201d Are suburban in character; Are less dense than town centers; Lack the integrated mix of uses found in town centers; Are defined primarily by a concentration and variety of office, retail, professional, and light industrial uses, and generally have more jobs than residents; and are generally auto dependent rather than transit oriented or pedestrian scale.</p><p><br /></p><p></p><p>TOWN CENTERS</p><p>Have a mixture of high-density residential and commercial land use; Have an integrated mix of land uses; Have a unique history, character, and sense of place; Are of relatively higher density than their surrounding land uses; Have a distinct downtown/main street area surrounded by relatively dense residential development; Are pedestrian friendly and often transit oriented; and Are surrounded by suburban land uses.</p><p><br /></p><p></p><p>RURAL CENTERS</p><p>Have a minimum density of six people and three employees per developed acre; Have an integrated mix of land uses; Have a unique history, character, and sense of place; Are of relatively higher density than the surrounding area; Have a distinct downtown/main street (though smaller than a town center); and Are surrounded by rural and agricultural land uses. </p><p><br /></p><p></p><p>PLANNED CENTERS</p><p>Are planned town-center-type developments on greenfields in Growing Suburbs or Rural Areas or through redevelopment on greyfields and/or brownfields in Developed Communities; and Have plans that call for village-type development, incorporating mixed, integrated land uses, relatively high densities, and pedestrian connections.</p>", "keyword": ["DVRPC", "Connections 2045", "LongRange Plan", "Planned Centers", "Core Cities", "Neighborhood Centers", "Planning", "2045"], "title": "DVRPC Connections 2045 Planning Center Neighborhoods", "issued": "2018-07-16T14:58:55.000Z", "modified": "2018-07-27T19:12:24.216Z", "theme": ["geospatial"], "landingPage": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/19bd12419d6a402e8cabbeded6652f20_0", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/19bd12419d6a402e8cabbeded6652f20_0", "mediaType": "text/html", "format": "Web page", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Open Dataset"}, {"accessURL": "https://services1.arcgis.com/LWtWv6q6BJyKidj8/arcgis/rest/services/DVRPC_Connections_2045_Planning_Center_Neighborhoods/FeatureServer/0", "mediaType": "application/json", "format": "Esri REST", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Esri Rest API"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/19bd12419d6a402e8cabbeded6652f20_0.geojson", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "format": "GeoJSON", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/19bd12419d6a402e8cabbeded6652f20_0.csv", "mediaType": "text/csv", "format": "CSV", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/19bd12419d6a402e8cabbeded6652f20_0.kml", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "format": "KML", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/19bd12419d6a402e8cabbeded6652f20_0.zip", "mediaType": "application/zip", "format": "ZIP", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile"}], "spatial": "-75.97735245108142,39.68529071004865,-74.52373909865224,40.440132436798976", "license": "https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/19bd12419d6a402e8cabbeded6652f20_0/license", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:wstevens@dvrpc.org", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "DVRPC MPO"}, "identifier": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/19bd12419d6a402e8cabbeded6652f20_0", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "webService": "https://services1.arcgis.com/LWtWv6q6BJyKidj8/arcgis/rest/services/DVRPC_Connections_2045_Planning_Center_Neighborhoods/FeatureServer/0"}, {"publisher": {"name": "DVRPC-GIS"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.dvrpc.org/Products/17039/\" target=\"_blank\">Connections 2045 Plan for Greater Philadelphia - Administrative Version DVRPC Publication No. 17039 12/2017</a><br /></p><p>The Plan proposes linking and expanding the region\u2019s existing protected natural areas into a Greenspace Network, where parks, forests, meadows, stream corridors, and floodplains are joined together in an interconnected system.

The Connections 2045 Long-Range Plan characterizes each of the region\u2019s municipalities as either a Core City, Developed Community, Growing Suburb, or Rural Area, as a means of categorizing the types of communities and defining the corresponding long-range planning policies most appropriate for each type. This categorization is shown on the Planning Areas and Centers dataset. </p><p>Many municipalities have areas within their boundaries that fit the characteristics of more than one of these Planning Area types. Gloucester Township (in Camden County, New Jersey), for example, has neighborhoods that are fully developed, but it also has a significant number of undeveloped acres and forecasted population and employment growth more characteristic of a Growing Suburb. The intent of the Plan is to assign to each municipality the planning area type associated with the long-range planning policies that will be most beneficial to the entire community. While the Planning Areas and Centers map is a guide for policy direction at the regional scale, actual approaches should always be guided by local conditions.</p><p>The region\u2019s four Core Cities are Philadelphia, Trenton, Camden, and Chester. Targeted infrastructure investment, maintenance and rehabilitation, comprehensive neighborhood revitalization, and efforts focused on reinforcing a network of social and educational programs will help to rebuild and revitalize the region\u2019s cities.</p><p>Developed Communities are places that have already experienced most of their population and employment growth, and include inner ring communities adjacent to the Core Cities; railroad boroughs and trolley car communities; and mature suburban townships. Many of these communities are stable and thriving, offering affordable housing opportunities; access to transit; safe pedestrian and bicycling environments; and a strong community identity. Others, however, are experiencing population and employment losses; have deteriorating infrastructure systems; have aging resident populations living on limited incomes; and have stagnant or declining tax bases that cannot keep pace with rising service demands. Rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure systems and the housing stock, and local economic and community development can help to reinforce location advantages, while stabilizing neighborhoods and stemming decline.</p><p>Growing Suburbs are communities that have a significant number of developable acres remaining and are experiencing or are forecast to experience significant population and/or employment growth. Key planning policies in these communities focus on the need to improve the form of development, reduce congestion, and mitigate the negative consequences of unmanaged growth, and include growth management and enhanced community design. Smart growth techniques that support a more concentrated development pattern (such as clustering, mixed uses, transit-oriented development, and transfer of development rights) can provide the critical mass necessary to support new transit services and other alternatives to the automobile. The quality of design and architectural character of the built environment, open space preservation, and the creation of an integrated system of open space and recreation are all priorities in these communities.</p><p>Rural Areas include the region\u2019s agricultural communities and communities with large remaining natural areas. Key policy approaches for these communities focus on preservation and limiting development, and include limited expansion of infrastructure systems, preservation of a rural lifestyle and village character, support for continued farming, and enhanced natural resource protection.

The minimum size for building features is 200 square feet.</p>\n<p>Process Steps for Calculating Building Height Statistics:</p>\n<p>Normalized digital surface models (nDSM) and slope rasters were generated from 0.5-meter LiDAR data.</p>\n<p>Geodesic area was calculated (in square feet) for all features classified as \u2018Building\u2019.</p>\n<p>A negative 1 meter buffer was applied to all building features with an area greater than 200 square meters - applied in an effort to ensure nDSM input values were those corresponding to the building roof and not the adjacent ground.</p>\n<p>Zonal statistics (Spatial Analyst extension) were calculated on the buffered features for each nDSM raster (first multiplying each raster by 10 to maintain precision and then converting from floating point to integer raster) and slope raster (generated from each integerized nDSM raster). Zonal percentile statistics were also calculated on buffered features for each raster to obtain the 90th percentile building heights (HEIGHT_ESTIMATE field).</p>\n<p>All output statistics fields were joined to the original input feature class (with unit conversions applied, where necessary).</p>\n<p>A complete dataset, which includes the following fields that are populated with various statistical outputs generated during the building height estimation process, is available upon request:</p>\n<p>HEIGHT_PCT90 \u2013 90th percentile value of all cells in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.</p>\n<p>HEIGHT_PCT50 \u2013 median value of all cells in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.</p>\n<p>HEIGHT_COUNT \u2013 total number of cells with tabulated values in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.</p>\n<p>SLOPE_MEAN \u2013 average of all cells in the slope raster located within the building footprint.</p>\n<p>SLOPE_STD \u2013 standard deviation of all cells in the slope raster located within the building footprint.</p>\n<p>SLOPE_COUNT - total number of cells with tabulated values in the slope raster located within the building footprint.</p>", "keyword": ["DVRPC", "Impervious Surface", "Structures", "Building Footprints", "Building Heights", "Buildings", "Roads", "Driveways", "Parking Lots", "Sidewalks", "Delaware County", "Pennsylvania", "Planning"], "title": "DVRPC 2015 Impervious Surface - Delaware County, PA", "issued": "2017-04-05T20:57:25.000Z", "modified": "2019-03-31T12:24:35.775Z", "theme": ["geospatial"], "landingPage": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/21db5bb43057439f8e7a9dc14a0fa1ef_0", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/21db5bb43057439f8e7a9dc14a0fa1ef_0", "mediaType": "text/html", "format": "Web page", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Open Dataset"}, {"accessURL": "https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/arcgis/rest/services/Structures/DelawareCo_Impervious/FeatureServer/0", "mediaType": "application/json", "format": "Esri REST", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Esri Rest API"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/21db5bb43057439f8e7a9dc14a0fa1ef_0.geojson", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "format": "GeoJSON", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/21db5bb43057439f8e7a9dc14a0fa1ef_0.csv", "mediaType": "text/csv", "format": "CSV", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/21db5bb43057439f8e7a9dc14a0fa1ef_0.kml", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "format": "KML", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/21db5bb43057439f8e7a9dc14a0fa1ef_0.zip", "mediaType": "application/zip", "format": "ZIP", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile"}], "spatial": "-75.6003,39.8011,-75.2083,40.0706", "license": "https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/21db5bb43057439f8e7a9dc14a0fa1ef_0/license", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:wstevens@dvrpc.org", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "DVRPC MPO"}, "identifier": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/21db5bb43057439f8e7a9dc14a0fa1ef_0", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "webService": "https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/arcgis/rest/services/Structures/DelawareCo_Impervious/FeatureServer/0"}, {"publisher": {"name": "DVRPC-GIS"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "Every five years, since 1990, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission has produced a GIS Land Use layer for its 9-county region.

This analytical data report provides revised 2040 and interim-year population and employment forecasts for the DVRPC region\u2019s counties and municipalities. DVRPC prepared these forecasts in order to incorporate the results of the 2010 Census, account for the ongoing economic recession, and maintain a 30-year planning horizon. 2040 population forecasts were originally adopted by the DVRPC Board on January 26, 2012 and published in April 2012 in Analytical Data Report 18. On February 28, 2013, the DVRPC Board amended the 2040 and interim year population forecasts for Upper Merion Township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to account for a significant residential development that was unforeseen when the 2040 population forecasts were adopted in January 2012. This amendment resulted in corresponding revisions to the population forecasts for Montgomery County and the DVRPC region as a whole. This amended analytical data report includes these revisions. This report also consolidates the adopted population forecasts for Princeton Township and Princeton Borough in Mercer County, New Jersey, which merged and became one municipality known simply as Princeton on January 1, 2013. Additionally, inconsistencies in some summary totals in ADR 18 caused by rounding were also corrected. The adopted population forecasts provided in this report will serve as the basis for DVRPC\u2019s planning and modeling activities, along with the 2040 employment forecasts that were prepared and adopted in September 2012.NETS database for 2010 was used for employment data.http://www.dvrpc.org/asp/pubs/publicationabstract.asp?pub_id=ADR019http://www.dvrpc.org/asp/pubs/publicationabstract.asp?pub_id=ADR018-ASource of geographic boundaries: DVRPC", "keyword": ["Demographics", "Population", "Employment", "Municipality", "Forecast"], "title": "DVRPC Demographic and Employment Forecast Data by Municipality - 2010 to 2040", "issued": "2016-02-17T14:05:27.000Z", "modified": "2017-09-21T16:08:13.000Z", "theme": ["geospatial"], "landingPage": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e1e3beb6aa144f2b8dd07693567077cc_0", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e1e3beb6aa144f2b8dd07693567077cc_0", "mediaType": "text/html", "format": "Web page", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Open Dataset"}, {"accessURL": "https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/arcgis/rest/services/Demographics/PopEmpForecastMCD/FeatureServer/0", "mediaType": "application/json", "format": "Esri REST", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Esri Rest API"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e1e3beb6aa144f2b8dd07693567077cc_0.geojson", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "format": "GeoJSON", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e1e3beb6aa144f2b8dd07693567077cc_0.csv", "mediaType": "text/csv", "format": "CSV", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e1e3beb6aa144f2b8dd07693567077cc_0.kml", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "format": "KML", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e1e3beb6aa144f2b8dd07693567077cc_0.zip", "mediaType": "application/zip", "format": "ZIP", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile"}], "spatial": "-76.151337,39.509354,-74.381483,40.608726", "license": "https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/e1e3beb6aa144f2b8dd07693567077cc_0/license", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:wstevens@dvrpc.org", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "DVRPC MPO"}, "identifier": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e1e3beb6aa144f2b8dd07693567077cc_0", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "webService": "https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/arcgis/rest/services/Demographics/PopEmpForecastMCD/FeatureServer/0"}, {"publisher": {"name": "DVRPC-GIS"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "<div><p>Selected data from the Census Bureau's 2010-2014 ACS dataset for tracts in the DVRPC Region.

The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.</p><p></p><p><br /></p></div>", "keyword": ["Demographics", "DVRPC", "Census", "American Community Survey"], "title": "DVRPC 2014 Tract-level Demographic Profiles", "issued": "2016-06-02T14:13:56.000Z", "modified": "2017-09-21T16:04:47.000Z", "theme": ["geospatial"], "landingPage": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d60cbfe7291647fbb2b3acf61dac1e81_0", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d60cbfe7291647fbb2b3acf61dac1e81_0", "mediaType": "text/html", "format": "Web page", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Open Dataset"}, {"accessURL": "https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/arcgis/rest/services/Demographics/DemoProfile2014Tracts/FeatureServer/0", "mediaType": "application/json", "format": "Esri REST", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Esri Rest API"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d60cbfe7291647fbb2b3acf61dac1e81_0.geojson", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "format": "GeoJSON", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d60cbfe7291647fbb2b3acf61dac1e81_0.csv", "mediaType": "text/csv", "format": "CSV", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d60cbfe7291647fbb2b3acf61dac1e81_0.kml", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "format": "KML", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML"}, {"downloadURL": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d60cbfe7291647fbb2b3acf61dac1e81_0.zip", "mediaType": "application/zip", "format": "ZIP", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile"}], "spatial": "-76.1514,39.5093,-74.3813,40.6087", "license": "https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/d60cbfe7291647fbb2b3acf61dac1e81_0/license", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:wstevens@dvrpc.org", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "DVRPC MPO"}, "identifier": "http://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d60cbfe7291647fbb2b3acf61dac1e81_0", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "webService": "https://arcgis.dvrpc.org/arcgis/rest/services/Demographics/DemoProfile2014Tracts/FeatureServer/0"}], "@type": "dcat:Catalog", "describedBy": "https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/catalog.json"}
