The polygons contained in \nthis feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel \nfeature class.  Each parcel was categorized by its land use.  When a \nparcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. \n\n<br /><br />Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources \nused to attribute each tax parcel with land use information.  The data \nwas collected in 2001. \n\n<br /><br />Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number).  \nLand Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel.  The Key Pin \nis the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel\n to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland \nCounty Land Records.<br /><br />The development process consists of three \nbasic steps.\u00a0 First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate \nto a single land use are categorized as such.\u00a0 Second, parcels with a \nuse code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are \nmanually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference.\n Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to \ncreate a single land use dataset.<br /><br />Assumptions:<br /><br />Any parcel \nclassified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly \nowned, improved parcel.\u00a0 In this event, the vacant parcel is \nreclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved \nparcel.\u00a0 It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV,\n SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from \nthis assumption.<br /><br />Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV,\n or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation &amp;\n Conservation (due to subdivision open space).\u00a0 These parcels are not \nmanually checked.\u00a0 Queries are conducted to search for those parcels \nthat are subdivision open space.\u00a0 The following strings are queried from\n the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: &quot;*own*&quot; (unknown, homeowner), &quot;ass*&quot; \n(association, ass'n, etc), and &quot;park.&quot;<br /><br />The Equalization use code \nBI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as \nCommercial/Office.\u00a0 Uses may also fall into Public/Institutional, \nhowever, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification.<br /><br />The\n Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are\n reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, \nCommercial/Office, or Mobile Home Park.<br /><br />The Equalization use code\n ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as \nRecreation &amp; Conservation, Public/Institutional, Transportation, \nUtility &amp; Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any \nSingle Family classification.<br /><br />The Equalization use code KI, \nCondominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple \nFamily, Single Family, or Commercial/Office. <br /><br />Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.<br /><br />Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.<br /><br />Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use.<br /><br />Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.<br /><br />Any\n parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is \nconsidered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related \nuse.<br /><br />Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.<br /><br />Any\n parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may\n be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation &amp; Conservation, (golf \ncourses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).<br /><br />Polygons in the \nROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and \nConservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.<br /><br />Because\n of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of \ncreating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there\n may be exceptions from these assumptions.<br /><br />Exceptions:<br /><br />There\n are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously \noverstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.\u00a0 In these \ncases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel \nvacant.\u00a0 These parcels are

use.\u00a0 The polygons contained in this \nfeature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature \nclass.\u00a0 Each parcel was categorized by its land use.\u00a0 When a parcel has \nmultiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. \u00a0<br /><br />Assessing \nrecords and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute \neach tax parcel with land use information.\u00a0 The data was collected in \nAugust 2010. \u00a0<br /><br />Key attributes are the land use and key pin \n(Sidwell number).\u00a0 Land Use stores the Land Use description for each

/><br />The 2010 version of \nland use was created using the 2009 version as a primary source.\u00a0 It was\n assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were \nequal in both

The two major uses are\n cartographic output and creating summaries at various spatial extents.\n\n<br /><br />The intent of this feature class was to provide a \nvery general representation of a hard copy 1966 land use map.  The \nspatial accuracy and number of vertices used to represent each feature \nwas limited by the intended purpose of the data.\n\n<br /><br />The land use features were heads-up digitized from a 1966 land \nuse map that was scanned and georefereneced using each section corner as\n a control point.  The features were digitized at a scale not greater \nthan 1:15,000, one square-mile section at a time.  After the entire \ncounty was completely digitized, the features were dissolved based on \nthe Landuse.\n\n<br /><br />Right-of-Way was burned in to the final feature class using the \nfollowing process.  First, the current RoadCenterline feature class was \nmodifed to reflect roads in 1966 using the scanned 1966 land use map and\n 1963 orthophotography as a reference.  Next, the road lines were \nbuffered at specified distanced based on the RoadCode attribute from \nRoadCenterline to create polygons.  Major Roads were split into two \ntypes (Perscriptive Easement and Dedicated) based on if the adjacent \nproperty was platted prior to 1966.  According to the Oakland County \nRegister of Deeds, in 1966 Oakland County was recording documents in \nliber 120.  For the purpose of this feature class it was assumed that \nsimultaneous conveyances recorded in liber 120 or earlier existed in \n1966.  Major roads that intersected or were adjacent with these \nsimultaneous conveyances were classified as Dedicated and the remainder \nof Major Roads were classified as a Perscriptive Easement.  The buffer \ndistances, representing half the total Right-of-Way width, used for each\n road code are listed below:\n\n     <br /><br /><ul><li>Minor Road - 30 feet\n</li><li>     Major Road (Perscriptive Easement) - 33 feet\n     </li><li>Major Road (Dedicated) - 46.5 feet\n     </li><li>State Highway - 46.5 feet\n</li><li>U.S. Highway - 46.5 feet\n</li><li>     Interstate - 60 feet feet\n\n</li></ul>These Right-of-Way widths generally approximate \nthose that actually existed in 1966 and are not intended to indicate the\n exact width of a specific Right-of-Way.  All areas completely \nsurrounded by Right-of-Way such as between directions of travel of a \nboulevard or interstate or the area inside of a freeway interchange were\n manually attributed as Right-of-Way.\n\n<br /><br />Water features were burned in the final feature class using a \nmodified version the of the Oakland County Waterbody feature class.  \nThis data was modified to reflect waterbodies in 1966 using the 1966 \nland use map and 1963 orthophotography as a reference.\n\nLastly, the features that intersected community boudaries were split \nusing the Identity tool to increase cartographic and analytic \nperformance.</div>", "keyword": ["land use", "planning", "historic", "urban planning", "residential", "commercial", "open space"], "title": "OC Land Use 1966", "issued": "2016-10-16T18:08:08.000Z", "modified": "2018-11-01T19:52:26.986Z", "theme": ["geospatial"], "landingPage": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/f3b770fd11da46a5ada9a009eec23c9f_0", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/f3b770fd11da46a5ada9a009eec23c9f_0", "mediaType": "text/html", "format": "Web page", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Open Dataset"}, {"accessURL": "https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseLandUseMapService/MapServer/0", "mediaType": "application/json", "format": "Esri REST", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Esri Rest API"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/f3b770fd11da46a5ada9a009eec23c9f_0.geojson", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "format": "GeoJSON", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/f3b770fd11da46a5ada9a009eec23c9f_0.csv", "mediaType": "text/csv", "format": "CSV", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/f3b770fd11da46a5ada9a009eec23c9f_0.kml", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "format": "KML", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/f3b770fd11da46a5ada9a009eec23c9f_0.zip", "mediaType": "application/zip", "format": "ZIP", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile"}], "spatial": "-83.694337,42.426087,-83.074282,42.893598", "license": "https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/f3b770fd11da46a5ada9a009eec23c9f_0/license", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:ocagoadmin@oakgov.com", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Susan Moore"}, "identifier": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/f3b770fd11da46a5ada9a009eec23c9f_0", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "webService": "https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseLandUseMapService/MapServer/0"}, {"publisher": {"name": "Oakland County, Michigan"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "<div>BY USING THIS WEBSITE OR THE CONTENT THEREIN, YOU AGREE TO THE\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.oakgov.com/open-data-terms\">TERMS OF USE</a>.\u00a0<br /></div><div>This polygon feature class was initially derived with data from School \nDistrict, Tax, and Municipal feature classes and historical School Board\n correspondence.

The polygons contained in this \nfeature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature \nclass. Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has \nmultiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. <br /><br />Assessing \nrecords and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute \neach tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in \n2014. <br /><br />Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell \nnumber). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The \nKey Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link \nthe parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in \nOakland County Land Records.<br /><br />The 2015 version of land use was created using the 2013 version as a \nprimary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number \nand the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not \nchange. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned\n a land use. To ensure the quality of the land use data, however, \nseveral types of use codes were manually checked again for this update \nto enusre the assigned use is still accurate. Also, reference data such \nas the Adult Care, Public Beach, and Recreation Land feature classes the\n were used to locate misrepresented parcels. <br /><br />The development \nprocess consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes \nthat are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such.\n Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than \none land use are manually classified using orthophotography and \nownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and \nhydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset. <br /><br />Assumptions: <br />In\n 2005, Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have \nchanged from using the use codes described below to property class \ncodes. These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose\n of this data. One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer\n recorded using the &quot;ME, Miscellaneous Exempt&quot; use code, but are instead\n usually classifed as &quot;RV, Residential Vacant.&quot; The &quot;Taxable&quot; field was \nreferenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and \ngovernemnt-owned property during this land use update. <br /><br />Any \nparcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, \ncommonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is \nreclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved \nparcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, \nSV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from \nthis assumption. <br /><br />Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, \nSV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation \n&amp; Conservation (due to subdivision open space). These parcels are \nnot manually checked. Queries are conducted to search for those parcels \nthat are subdivision open space. The following strings are queried from \nthe Owner1 and Owner2 fields: &quot;*own*&quot; (unknown, homeowner), &quot;ass*&quot; \n(association, ass'n, etc), and &quot;park.&quot; <br /><br />The Equalization use code\n BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as \nCommercial/Office. Uses may also fall into Public/Institutional, \nhowever, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification. <br /><br />The\n Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are\n reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, \nCommercial/Office, or Mobile Home Park. <br /><br />The Equalization use \ncode ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as \nRecreation &amp; Conservation, Public/Institutional, Transportation, \nUtility &amp; Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any \nSingle Family classification. <br /><br />The Equalization use code KI, \nCondominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple \nFamily, Single Family, or Commercial/Office.

Box 13036, Lansing, MI 48901 (Report Number 2017-17) at <a href=\"https://www.oakgov.com/it/gis/Documents/metadata/Oakland_2017_PNA_Final_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.oakgov.com/it/gis/Documents/metadata/Oakland_2017_PNA_Final_Report.pdf</a>. This document provides essential information for the attributes and procedures used to create the features in the dataset.<br /><br />The purpose of this assessment was to delineate the highest quality patches of natural land cover within high scoring potential natural areas (PNAs) that demonstrate the greatest opportunity for conservation value. Conservation value can be defined by a number of different factors, such as: the presence of rare and declining species, high plant and/or animal species diversity, structural diversity, presence of biological legacies such as large dead and downed trees, intact ecological processes, intact hydrology, and/or lack of key threats. The problem is that all of these factors are almost impossible to detect from aerial imagery, and almost always require field inspection.<br /><br />However, understanding that there are limitations with remote analysis, this assessment was based on aerial imagery from several different time periods: 1940, 1963 and 2015. The earliest time period available for aerial imagery of Oakland County was from the 1940. As with most of the Lower Peninsula, Oakland County had been significantly altered by European settler activities by the turn of the 20th century. This is the best representation of patches of forests and wetlands that appear to still be intact almost 80 years ago. A key habitat type that is missing from this landscape analysis is grassland. Unfortunately, native grassland systems such as prairie, savanna, and barrens, were virtually eliminated by the early 1900s throughout Michigan, and the remaining small, isolated patches of native grassland are essentially impossible to identify from old, low quality, black and white aerial photographs.<br /><br />Due to the fact that there were not enough funds or resources to delineate and characterize every patch of natural land cover within every PNA, the first step in the process was to identify PNAs with the highest potential for conserving ecological value. That was determined by three key factors: 1) PNA total scores (with enhanced criteria), 2) percentage of private land (higher the better), and 3) proximity to public land (closer the better). First, all enhanced criteria total scores greater than 15 were identified. From that selection, PNAs with greater than fifty percent private ownership were selected. This was determined using the Oakland County 2015 conservation lands database. These were placed in the first priority category for natural community assessment. Once those were selected, PNAs adjacent to or in close proximity to publically owned lands were the first to be evaluated for high quality natural land cover. There were a total of 70 first priority PNAs. Once these were assessed, a second set of PNAs were identified. Although these PNAs also had high total scores (based on the enhanced criteria), they also had a higher percentage of public land; in some cases they were 100 percent publically owned. A key factor for prioritization was the amount of privately owned land (the higher the better), and whether or not the area had been surveyed within the past 20 years. The majority of the highest ranking second priority PNAs had some form of regional or local public ownership (as opposed to state ownership, such as state park and recreation areas). A total of 18 second priority PNAs was identified.<br /><br />Once the priority PNAs were identified, the next step in the process was to determine which patches of natural land cover within these PNAs, had a high probability of still being in good condition. This was done by identifying all natural land cover patches from the 1940 aerial photographs. Once these patches were identified, the next step was to eliminate all portions of these patches that demonstrated major alterations based on the 1963 aerial photographs. In addition, forest patches or portions of forest patches that did not show up as forest on the digital USGS quadrangle topographic maps were also removed. All remaining patches of habitat were considered high quality, and delineated using heads up digitizing. They were also attributed with primary land cover type, size, and notes. Primary land cover types used for this analysis included: 1) lowland deciduous forest, 2) lowland mixed forest, 3) lowland conifer forest, 4) non-forested wetland, 5) mixed wetland complex, and 6) upland forest. These cover types were chosen because of the high confidence levels for delineating each type in this portion of Michigan\u2019s Lower Peninsula. If an MNFI Scientist was able to identify more specific natural community types based on topography, soils, hydrology, aspect distinct aerial imagery signature, or other factors, that information was also included in the notes field of the database.<br /><br /><br />Reference Reports:<br /><br />Shiawassee &amp; Huron Headwaters Resource Preservation Project - March 2000 Project Staff: Carlisle Wortman &amp; Associates - Richard Carlisle, PCP, and Carey Nyberg Land Information Access Association - Joe VanderMeulen Michigan Natural Features Inventory - John Paskus Oakland County Planning &amp; Economic Development Services - Bret C.

The polygons contained in this \nfeature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature \nclass. Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has \nmultiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. <br /><br />Assessing \nrecords and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute \neach tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in \n2015. <br /><br />Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell \nnumber). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The \nKey Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link \nthe parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in \nOakland County Land Records.<br /><br />The 2015 version of land use was \ncreated using the 2014 version as a primary source. It was assumed that \nif the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both \nyears, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a \nchange occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of \nthe land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually \nchecked again for this update to enusre the assigned use is still \naccurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and\n Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented \nparcels. <br /><br />The development process consists of three basic steps. \nFirst, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single \nland use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that \nis assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified \nusing orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax \nparcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single \nland use dataset. <br /><br />Assumptions: <br />In 2005, Oakland County \nEqualization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the\n use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were \ninterpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major\n change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the &quot;ME,\n Miscellaneous Exempt&quot; use code, but are instead usually classifed as \n&quot;RV, Residential Vacant.&quot; The &quot;Taxable&quot; field was referenced to locate \ntax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned \nproperty during this land use update. <br /><br />Any parcel classified as \nvacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved \nparcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of \nthe adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, \nhowever, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a\n single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption. <br /><br />Parcels\n with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be \nreclassified as Vacant or Recreation &amp; Conservation (due to \nsubdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries\n are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open \nspace. The following strings are queried from the Owner1 and Owner2 \nfields: &quot;*own*&quot; (unknown, homeowner), &quot;ass*&quot; (association, ass'n, etc), \nand &quot;park.&quot; <br /><br />The Equalization use code BI, Business Improved \nincludes uses that are reclassified as Commercial/Office. Uses may also \nfall into Public/Institutional, however, all BI parcels are not manually\n checked for reclassification. <br /><br />The Equalization use code MM, \nMiscellaneous Business includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation\n and Conservation, Multiple Family, Commercial/Office, or Mobile Home \nPark. <br /><br />The Equalization use code ME, Miscellaneous Exempt \nincludes uses that are reclassified as Recreation &amp; Conservation, \nPublic/Institutional, Transportation, Utility &amp; Communication, \nIndustrial (municipal landfills), or any Single Family classification. <br /><br />The\n Equalization use code KI, Condominium Improved includes uses that are \nreclassified as Multiple Family, Single Family, or Commercial/Office. \nAny parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, \nFarm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use. <br /><br />Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use. <br /><br />Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use. <br /><br />Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use. <br /><br />Any\n parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is \nconsidered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related \nuse. <br /><br />Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant. <br /><br />Any\n parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may\n be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation &amp; Conservation, (golf \ncourses) or Industrial (mining or extractive). <br /><br />Polygons in the \nROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and \nConservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.\n <br /><br />Because of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and \nthe goal of creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its \nmetadata, there may be exceptions from these assumptions.<br /><br />Exceptions: <br />There\n are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously \noverstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use. In these \ncases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel \nvacant.

These features were captured using a combination of a surface TIN derived from 10-foot contours and a detailed original map of Oakland County surficial geology by Twenter and Knutilla, 1972. Polygons were delineated on a hard-copy map by John Zawiskie, Cranbrook geologist. The map was then scanned and registered to Oakland County GIS data. The polygons were digitized on-screen. Data was collected at approximately 1:1200; however the original map was produced at a countywide scale. The key attribute is the geologic sediment type.<br /><br />The primary business purpose for the development of this data set was to collaborate with the Cranbrook Institute of Science in producing an educational map about the surficial geology of Oakland County at a scale appropriate to Countywide and sub-County applications. Prior work by Farrand and Bell (1982) mapped surficial geology deposits of the entire state; however the data is too coarse to have meaningful application at a county and sub-County scale. An improved data set was created by combining Oakland's detailed digital topography with a more detailed geology map. Secondary business purposes include natural resources planning and environmental analysis. For example, this map was used to create an aquifer vulnerability map analysis as part of a countywide water resources study conducted by the United States Geological Survey.<br /><br />These features were captured using a combination of a surface TIN derived from 10-foot contours and a detailed original map of Oakland County surficial geology by Twenter and Knutilla, 1972. Polygons were delineated on a hard-copy map by John Zawiskie, Cranbrook geologist. The map was then scanned and registered to Oakland County GIS data. The polygons were digitized on-screen. Data was collected at approximately 1:1200; however the original map was produced at a countywide scale. Zawiskie QC'd the data through visual inspections of plots, and Nina Misuraca instituted the corrections.", "keyword": ["geology", "glacial deposits", "glacial geology", "surface geology", "outwash", "surficial geology", "geoscientificInformation", "glacial", "moraine", "Oakland County", "environment"], "title": "OC Surface Geology", "issued": "2016-10-16T18:21:42.000Z", "modified": "2018-11-01T19:34:27.076Z", "theme": ["geospatial"], "landingPage": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/fe466bc4787d42fc96a878764c6566bb_4", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/fe466bc4787d42fc96a878764c6566bb_4", "mediaType": "text/html", "format": "Web page", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Open Dataset"}, {"accessURL": "https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseNaturalFeaturesMapService/MapServer/4", "mediaType": "application/json", "format": "Esri REST", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Esri Rest API"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/fe466bc4787d42fc96a878764c6566bb_4.geojson", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "format": "GeoJSON", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/fe466bc4787d42fc96a878764c6566bb_4.csv", "mediaType": "text/csv", "format": "CSV", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/fe466bc4787d42fc96a878764c6566bb_4.kml", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "format": "KML", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/fe466bc4787d42fc96a878764c6566bb_4.zip", "mediaType": "application/zip", "format": "ZIP", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile"}], "spatial": "-83.694337,42.426087,-83.074282,42.893598", "license": "https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/fe466bc4787d42fc96a878764c6566bb_4/license", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:ocagoadmin@oakgov.com", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Susan Moore"}, "identifier": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/fe466bc4787d42fc96a878764c6566bb_4", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "webService": "https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseNaturalFeaturesMapService/MapServer/4"}, {"publisher": {"name": "Oakland County, Michigan"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "BY USING THIS WEBSITE OR THE CONTENT THEREIN, YOU AGREE TO THE\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.oakgov.com/open-data-terms\">TERMS OF USE</a>. <br />Oakland Counties Global Oakland foreign owned firms.

A digital orthoimage is a raster\nimage processed from vertical aerial images in which displacement in the image\ndue to sensor orientation and terrain relief have been removed. Orthoimagery\ncombines the image characteristics of an image with the geometric qualities of\na map. Unlike planimetric maps which depict natural and manmade features by\nmeans of lines, point symbols, texts and polygons, orthoimagery illustrates the\nactual images of features and are thus more easily interpreted than regular\nmaps. The normal orientation of data in an orthoimage is by lines (rows) and\nsamples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to\neast with the order of the lines from north to south. Each image tile is stored\nin industry standard TIFF (tagged interchange file format) with an associated\nTIFF world file. Aerial imagery was acquired between April 12 and 15 2015 from\nflying heights of approximately 1400-1640 feet above ground level (AGL). Each\northoimage tile is 2500feet X 2500feet in dimension, edge-tied with the\nadjacent tiles (no gap and no overlap).

Unlike planimetric maps which depict natural and manmade features by\nmeans of lines, point symbols, texts and polygons, orthoimagery illustrates the\nactual images of features and are thus more easily interpreted than regular\nmaps. The normal orientation of data in an orthoimage is by lines (rows) and\nsamples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to\neast with the order of the lines from north to south. Each image tile is stored\nin industry standard TIFF (tagged interchange file format) with an associated\nTIFF world file. Aerial imagery was acquired between April 12 and 15 2015 from\nflying heights of approximately 1400-1640 feet above ground level (AGL). Each\northoimage tile is 2500feet X 2500feet in dimension, edge-tied with the\nadjacent tiles (no gap and no overlap).

Box 30444 8th Floor, Mason Bldg. Lansing, MI 48909-7944 <br /><br />This\n report identifies and ranks Potential Natural Areas remaining in \nOakland County. Potential Natural Areas are defined as places on the \nlandscape dominated by native vegetation that have various levels of \npotential for harboring high quality natural areas and unique natural \nfeatures. In addition these areas may provide critical ecological \nservices such as maintaining water quality and quantity, soil \ndevelopment and stabilization, pollination of cropland, wildlife travel \ncorridors, stopover sites for migratory birds, sources of genetic \ndiversity, and floodwater retention. However, the actual ecological \nvalue of these areas can only be truly ascertained through on the ground\n biological surveys. The process established by the Michigan Natural \nFeatures Inventory (MNFI) of identifying potential conservation areas \ncan also be used to update and track the status of these remaining \nsites. The site map and ranking data can be used by local \nmunicipalities, land trusts, and other agencies to prioritize \nconservation efforts and assist in finding opportunities to establish an\n open space system of linked natural areas throughout Oakland County. <br /><br />In\n this report the term &quot;potential natural area&quot; has been used in place of\n the term &quot;potential conservation area&quot;. The substitution was made in \norder to convey to the reader a clearer picture of the type of sites \nthat are being delineated. It is felt that more people have a better \nunderstanding of the term &quot;natural area&quot;. The term &quot;potential natural \narea&quot;, however, is not to be confused with the legal term &quot;dedicated \nNatural Area&quot; as described in Part 351, Wilderness and Natural Areas, of\n the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act of 1994 which \ngives land special legal protection.<br /><br />When using this information \nit is important to keep in mind that site boundaries and ranking are a \nstarting point and tend to be somewhat general in nature. Consequently, \neach community, group or individual using this information should \ndetermine what additional expertise is needed in order to establish more\n exact boundaries and the most appropriate conservation efforts. <br /><br />Materials and Interpretation Methodology: <br />Interpretation\n of the 25-township area in Oakland County was conducted by using \ndigital aerial photography taken in 2002, Tax Parcel, and 2002 Oakland \nCounty Potential Conservation/Natural Areas provided by Oakland County's\n Planning and Economic Development Services Division. <br /><br />As the \ntownships were methodically interpreted and digitized using this \nimagery, the same areas were examined using: Southeast Michigan Council \nof Governments (SEMCOG) 2000 digital landcover, Michigan Center for \nGeographic Information (MCGI) MI Geographic Framework Hydrography (v3b),\n and Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) Biotics Database. These \nadditional data sources were used to enhance and corroborate the \ninterpretation process. <br /><br />Delineation of sites was done through \naerial photo interpretation, with emphasis placed on 1) intactness, 2) \nwetlands and wetland complexes, 3) riparian corridors, and 4) forested \ntracts. Delineation of sites during this phase of the process was done \nconservatively, such that the chance of capturing sites that may end up \nbeing eliminated upon closer inspection, was greater than the chance of \nomitting sites that should have been delineated. Sites were delineated \nby focusing on wetlands and forest tracts and eliminating as much \ndevelopment (including roads), active agriculture and old fields as \npossible. Boundaries typically were defined by hard edges such as roads,\n parking lots, developments, and railroad beds. All potential natural \nareas were identified and delineated regardless of size. Municipal \nboundaries were not utilized to delineate site boundaries unless the \nboundary corresponded to a defined hard edge, such as a road. Once all \nsites were delineated, sites under 20 acres were deleted. <br /><br />Following\n the aerial photo interpretation and the delineation of potential \nnatural areas, a more rigorous level of examination was undertaken based\n upon specific scaled criteria to prioritize sites. The criteria used to\n first delineate the sites were translated to a numerical scale. Each \nsite could then be assessed based upon the scaled criteria and a total \ncalculated score, based upon the sum of the scores for each criterion.", "keyword": ["natural features", "natural areas", "MNFI", "environment", "Conservation", "planning", "green space", "green belt", "Open Space Planning", "open space", "endangered species", "preservation"], "title": "OC 2004 MNFI Potential Natural Areas", "issued": "2016-10-16T18:55:49.000Z", "modified": "2016-11-07T17:56:14.000Z", "theme": ["geospatial"], "landingPage": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0", "mediaType": "text/html", "format": "Web page", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Open Dataset"}, {"accessURL": "https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseNaturalFeaturesMapService/MapServer/0", "mediaType": "application/json", "format": "Esri REST", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Esri Rest API"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0.geojson", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "format": "GeoJSON", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0.csv", "mediaType": "text/csv", "format": "CSV", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0.kml", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "format": "KML", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0.zip", "mediaType": "application/zip", "format": "ZIP", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile"}], "spatial": "-83.694337,42.426087,-83.074282,42.893598", "license": "https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0/license", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:ocagoadmin@oakgov.com", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Susan Moore"}, "identifier": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "webService": "https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseNaturalFeaturesMapService/MapServer/0"}, {"publisher": {"name": "Oakland County, Michigan"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "BY USING THIS WEBSITE OR THE CONTENT THEREIN, YOU AGREE TO THE\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.oakgov.com/open-data-terms\">TERMS OF USE</a>.\u00a0<br /><div>A spatial representation of ten-foot topographic contour lines.

of land use.\u00a0 The polygons contained in this \nfeature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature \nclass.\u00a0 Each parcel was categorized by its land use.\u00a0 When a parcel has \nmultiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. \u00a0<br /><br />Assessing \nrecords and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute \neach tax parcel with land use information.\u00a0 The data was collected in \n2011. \u00a0<br /><br />Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell \nnumber).\u00a0 Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel.\u00a0 The\n Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link \nthe parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in \nOakland County Land Records.<br /><br />The 2011 version of land use was \ncreated using the 2010 version as a primary source.\u00a0 It was assumed that\n if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both\n years, then the land use did not change.\u00a0 Thus, only the parcels where a\n change occured had to be assigned a land use.\u00a0 To ensure the quality of\n the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually \nchecked again for this update to enusre the assigned use is still \naccurate.\u00a0 Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, \nand Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate \nmisrepresented parcels.<br /><br />The development process consists of three\n basic steps.\u00a0 First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate \nto a single land use are categorized as such.\u00a0 Second, parcels with a \nuse code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are \nmanually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference.\n Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to \ncreate a single land use dataset.<br /><br />Assumptions:<br /><br />In 2005, \nOakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed\n from using the use codes described below to property class codes.\u00a0 \nThese codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of \nthis data.\u00a0 One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer \nrecorded using the &quot;ME, Miscellaneous Exempt&quot; use code, but are instead \nusually classifed as &quot;RV, Residential Vacant.&quot;\u00a0 The &quot;Taxable&quot; field was \nreferenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and \ngovernemnt-owned property during this land use update.<br /><br />Any parcel\n classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly \nowned, improved parcel.\u00a0 In this event, the vacant parcel is \nreclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved \nparcel.\u00a0 It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV,\n SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from \nthis

years, then the land use did not change.\u00a0 Thus, only the parcels where a\n change occured had to be assigned a land use.<br /><br />The development \nprocess consists of three basic steps.\u00a0 First, parcels with use codes \nthat are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as \nsuch.\u00a0 Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more\n than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and \nownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and \nhydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.<br /><br />Assumptions:<br /><br />Any\n parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, \ncommonly owned, improved parcel.\u00a0 In this event, the vacant parcel is \nreclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved \nparcel.\u00a0 It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV,\n SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from \nthis assumption.<br /><br />Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV,\n or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation &amp;\n Conservation (due to subdivision open space).\u00a0 These parcels are not \nmanually checked.\u00a0 Queries are conducted to search for those parcels \nthat are subdivision open space.\u00a0 The following strings are queried from\n the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: &quot;*own*&quot; (unknown, homeowner), &quot;ass*&quot; \n(association, ass'n, etc), and &quot;park.&quot;<br /><br />The Equalization use code \nBI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as \nCommercial/Office.\u00a0 Uses may also fall into Public/Institutional, \nhowever, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification.<br /><br />The\n Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are\n reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, \nCommercial/Office, or Mobile Home Park.<br /><br />The Equalization use code\n ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as \nRecreation &amp; Conservation, Public/Institutional, Transportation, \nUtility &amp; Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any \nSingle Family classification.<br /><br />The Equalization use code KI, \nCondominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple \nFamily, Single Family, or Commercial/Office. <br /><br />Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.<br /><br />Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.<br /><br />Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use.<br /><br />Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.<br /><br />Any\n parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is \nconsidered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related \nuse.<br /><br />Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.<br /><br />Any\n parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may\n be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation &amp; Conservation, (golf \ncourses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).<br /><br />Polygons in the \nROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and \nConservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.<br /><br />Because\n of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of \ncreating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there\n may be exceptions from these assumptions.<br /><br />Exceptions:<br /><br />There\n are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously \noverstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.\u00a0 In these \ncases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel \nvacant.\u00a0 These parcels are listed below:<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 01-29-451-001<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 01-35-300-014<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 04-08-200-002<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 04-24-100-004<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 07-13-301-006<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 14-04-376-002<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 18-19-476-015<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 21-10-200-001<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 21-10-200-002</div>", "keyword": ["land use", "planning", "urban planning", "commercial", "residential", "Open Space Planning", "open space"], "title": "OC Land Use 2005", "issued": "2016-10-16T18:19:16.000Z", "modified": "2016-11-02T15:28:12.000Z", "theme": ["geospatial"], "landingPage": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/5cb62e15ea8e40a6b296e6a5f1bfb79c_5", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/5cb62e15ea8e40a6b296e6a5f1bfb79c_5", "mediaType": "text/html", "format": "Web page", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Open Dataset"}, {"accessURL": "https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseLandUseMapService/MapServer/5", "mediaType": "application/json", "format": "Esri REST", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Esri Rest API"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/5cb62e15ea8e40a6b296e6a5f1bfb79c_5.geojson", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "format": "GeoJSON", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/5cb62e15ea8e40a6b296e6a5f1bfb79c_5.csv", "mediaType": "text/csv", "format": "CSV", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/5cb62e15ea8e40a6b296e6a5f1bfb79c_5.kml", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "format": "KML", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML"}, {"downloadURL": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/5cb62e15ea8e40a6b296e6a5f1bfb79c_5.zip", "mediaType": "application/zip", "format": "ZIP", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile"}], "spatial": "-83.694337,42.426087,-83.074282,42.893598", "license": "https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/5cb62e15ea8e40a6b296e6a5f1bfb79c_5/license", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:ocagoadmin@oakgov.com", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Susan Moore"}, "identifier": "http://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/5cb62e15ea8e40a6b296e6a5f1bfb79c_5", "@type": "dcat:Dataset", "webService": "https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseLandUseMapService/MapServer/5"}, {"publisher": {"name": "Oakland County, Michigan"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "<div>BY USING THIS WEBSITE OR THE CONTENT THEREIN, YOU AGREE TO THE\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.oakgov.com/open-data-terms\">TERMS OF USE</a>.\u00a0</div><div>A spatial representation of hospitals.

This feature class currently represents Downtown Development Authorities (DDA), Tax Increment Finance Authorities (TIFA), and Local Development Finance Authorities (LDFA); however, it will also depict Corridor Improvement Authorities (CIA) and Brownfield Redevelopment Authorities (BRA) in the future. These five types of authorities have the ability to capture tax increment financing (TIF).\u00a0<br /><br />The features were digitized using legal descriptions, parcel lists, and maps that were provided to the State of Michigan Office of the Great Seal and/or Oakland County Equalization by the authority. The key attributes are Name (official name of the authority), Type (the type of development authority), and DevelopmentPlan (yes/no indicating if the feature represents an area that is part of a development plan and can caputre tax increment financing).<br /><br />Tax Increment Financing is a tool used to promote redevelopment and community improvement projects by channeling funding toward projects in targeted areas. TIF is captured from the increase of property values from a base year. Millage rates from taxing jurisdictions are applied to the increased value. The resulting tax revenue is directed to the authority, rather than the appropriate jurisdiction.\u00a0<br /><br />Beginning in 1994, taxing jurisdictions have the option to &quot;opt out&quot; of having its taxes captured by the authority. Also since 1994, school taxes may no longer be captured unless they are necessary to make payments on existing eligible obligations. For more information about TIF, see Michigan Department of Treasury's Tax Increment Financing FAQ web page at http://www.michigan.gov/treasury/0,1607,7-121-3218---F,00.html. The State of Michigan has adopted enabling legislation to allow TIF through five types of authorities. Each type of authority has a focus relating to development/redevelopment: Downtown Development Authority (PA 197 of 1975)\u00a0<br /><ul><li>Correct and prevent deterioration in business districts</li><li>Encourage historic preservation</li><li>Promote economic growth of the districts Tax Increment Finance Authority (PA 450 of 1980)</li><li>Prevent urban deterioration</li><li>Encourage economic development and activity</li><li>Encourage neighborhood revitalization and historic preservation</li><li>Closed to new applicants since 1987</li><li>Allows the development of virtually any type of land use Local Development Finance Authority (PA 281 of 1986)</li><li>Encourage local development</li><li>Promote conditions of employment</li><li>Promote economic growth</li><li>Limited to business activities involving:</li><li>Manufacturing</li><li>Agricultural processing</li><li>High-technology activities</li><li>Energy production</li><li>Business incubators Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (PA 381 of 1996)</li><li>Promote revitalization, redevelopment, and reuse of certain property</li><li>Focus on tax reverted, blighted, or functionally obsolete property</li><li>MDEQ must approve brownfield redevelopment areas Corridor Improvement Authority (PA 281 of 2005)</li><li>Correct and prevent deterioration in business districts</li><li>Encourage historic preservation</li><li>Promote economic growth of the districts</li><li>Must be adjacent to a road classified as an arterial or collector</li></ul>These quasi-public entities are created by resolution through a community's governing body. CIA and LDFA boundaries may cross municipal boundaries. In the case of these multi-jurisdictional authorities, both communities must pass resolutions establishing authority. There is currently only one Joint LDFA (Cities of Southfield and Troy) and there are no CIAs in Oakland County. When the community establishes the authority, it must also define the geographic boundaries in which it will operate. DDAs and CIAs are authorized to levy and collect taxes through a special assessment on all properties within the authority boundary.\u00a0<br /><br />After the authority and its boundaries are established, the authority creates a tax increment financing and development plan. The plan estimates the amount of tax increment financing that will be captured and lists specific projects on which it will be spent. It also defines the development area where the tax increment financing and projects will occur. The development area must be completely within the authority boundary; however, it may be coincident with the authority boundary.\u00a0<br /><br />An authority may contain multiple development areas, each with its own development and tax increment financing plan. BRAs normally designate development areas as a one or two parcels for a specific development project, while the other types of authorities define development areas as a larger area. Also, LDFAs are only allowed to capture TIF from parcels in a permitted use, such as manufacturing.\u00a0<br /><br />There may be both eliglible and inelgible parcels within a development area; however, the inelgible parcels do not participate in TIF capture. The base year used to calculate the amount of tax increment financing is set when the development plan is adopted. If the development plan is expanded at a later date, the base year could be reset for the entire development area or the capture could be calculated using multiple base years.\u00a0<br /><br />The source for the base year was the tax billing code used by Oakland County Equalization. When no tax billing code was available (for communities that don't use the county's assessing system), the community was contacted to obtain the base year. When two separate authorities overlap, each authority can establish overlapping development areas. The authority that first created the development area has first claim on tax increment financing capture.\u00a0<br /><br />Authority boundaries are represented using multiple features when the development area is not coincident with the authority boundary. One feature represents the development area and a second feature represents the remainder of the authority district that is not part of the development area. Multiple features are also used to represent authorities that have multiple development areas or development areas that have multiple base years.\u00a0<br /><br />Brownfield Redevelopment Authorities are unique in that the authority boundaries are generally defined as the entire municipality. For this reason, the non-development areas of BRA's have been excluded from this data. The following list shows communities in Oakland County that have established a BRA: City of Auburn Hills City of Birmingham City of Farmington City of Farmington Hills City of Ferndale City of Hazel Park Charter Township of Highland Village of Holly City of Madison Heights Village of Milford County of Oakland City of Oak Park City of Pontiac City of Rochester City of Rochester Hills Charter Twp of Royal Oak City of Royal Oak City of Southfield City of Troy Charter Township of Waterford\u00a0<br /><br />Source documents for the boundary of each feature were obtained from the State of Michigan Office of the Great Seal, Oakland County Equalization, and the Oakland County Treasurer's office. These could be in the form of a legal description, parcel list, and/or map.\u00a0<br /><br />For several boundaries, multiple sources were available and conflicted with each other. When this occurred, hierarchy was given to the legal description, then a parcel list, over the map, and the conflict is noted in the Comments field. However, if a parcel was shown in a parcel list, but not described in the authority based on the legal description, then it was still shown in the authority.<br /><br />It should also be noted that legal descriptions were not digitized using exact coordinate geometry. Instead, features were created by referencing the legal description to snap vertices to parcels, right-of-way, section corners, subdivisions, and lots. Features digitized from a legal description or map included road and railroad rights-of-way as it was described or shown in the document.<br /><br />For vague legal descriptions and parcel lists, right-of-way was addressed uniquely for each authority. Some source documents had statements that all or half of the surrounding right-of-way is to be included in the boundary, but some did not address right-of-way at all. In these cases, right-of-way was addressed distinctly for each authority based on the type of authority and the source documents with the method used recorded in the Comments field.\u00a0<br /><br />The data will be updated on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis when authorities amend their development plans or new authorities are established. Oakland County Equalization and the Oakland County Treasurer's Office will notify and forward the source documents of necessary revisions to Oakland County Planning and Economic Development Services who is the custodian of the feature class. Communities will be contacted annually to verify that the districts have not changed without the knowledge of county departments.
