The classified bare-earth data achieved the following: All areas shall be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 1.3 meters based on Wisconsin State Plane South, related to the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27), National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD 29) . Vertical accuracy was to achieve a RMSE Z of 0.50 ft (95% confidence level of less than 0.980 ft) or better in the &quot;Open Terrain&quot; land cover category for all areas.\r\n\r\nAccuracy statement is based on the area of moderate to flat terrain. Diminished accuracies are to be expected in areas in dense vegetation. The accuracy of the LiDAR data as tested met the vertical accuracy or better, however, derived products may be less accurate in areas of dense vegetation due to a lesser number of points defining the bare-earth in these areas.", "keyword": ["Racine County", "SEWRPC", "AeroMetric", "Environmental", "Planning"], "issued": "2015-11-04T17:34:15.000Z", "modified": "2017-01-04T17:58:55.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Racine County, WI"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "kim7785"}, "accessLevel": "public", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "accessURL": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1eb93a8a95c24a7c93a90e075c1e43a0_1"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Esri Rest API", "format": "Esri REST", "mediaType": "application/json", "accessURL": "https://arcgis.racinecounty.com/arcgis/rest/services/2010_LiDAR_Elevation/LiDAR_2010/MapServer/1"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON", "format": "GeoJSON", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "accessURL": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1eb93a8a95c24a7c93a90e075c1e43a0_1.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A6609%2C%22wkid%22%3A103191%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV", "format": "CSV", "mediaType": "text/csv", "accessURL": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1eb93a8a95c24a7c93a90e075c1e43a0_1.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A6609%2C%22wkid%22%3A103191%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML", "format": "KML", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "accessURL": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1eb93a8a95c24a7c93a90e075c1e43a0_1.kml?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A6609%2C%22wkid%22%3A103191%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile", "format": "ZIP", "mediaType": "application/zip", "accessURL": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1eb93a8a95c24a7c93a90e075c1e43a0_1.zip?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A6609%2C%22wkid%22%3A103191%7D"}], "spatial": "-88.313,42.6107,-87.7552,42.8408", "theme": ["geospatial"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "identifier": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0f0a83c57d63457b883e178f227db94e", "license": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0f0a83c57d63457b883e178f227db94e/license.json", "landingPage": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0f0a83c57d63457b883e178f227db94e", "title": "VillageofRochester 2035LandusePlan", "description": "\"The year 2035 regional land use plan incorporates the basic principles and concepts of the previously adopted plans.

by ProWest &amp; Associates Inc in January of 2019.<br /></div>&quot;The year 2035 regional land use plan incorporates the basic principles and concepts of the previously adopted plans. The plan promotes a compact, centralized regional settlement pattern, with urban development recommended to occur within, and along the periphery of, existing urban centers; promotes the location of new urban development in areas which are physically suitable for such development and which may be readily served by basic urban services, including sanitary sewer, water supply, and public transit services; and seeks to preserve the environmentally sensitive lands and the most productive farmlands in the Region. Like the previous plans, the new plan is advisory in nature. Plan implementation will depend largely upon the willingness of county and local governments to use land use controls to shape development patterns in the regional interest.  The year 2035 regional land use plan will provide a sound regional development framework needed in support of transportation and other public facility planning at the regional level, and in support of the preparation of comprehensive plans and related plan implementation efforts by county and local units of government in the Region. &quot;\nhttp://www.sewrpc.org/SEWRPCFiles/Publications/pr/pr-048_regional_land_use_plan_for_se_wi_2035.pdf", "keyword": ["SEWRPC", "RACINE COUNTY", "2035 Land Use Plan", "Planning", "Village of Mt Pleasant"], "issued": "2017-02-14T22:32:53.000Z", "modified": "2020-03-18T22:39:42.000Z", "publisher": {"name": "Racine County, WI"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "kim7785"}, "accessLevel": "public", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "accessURL": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8f24647e8c34487289dcdbe411bb769c_0"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Esri Rest API", "format": "Esri REST", "mediaType": "application/json", "accessURL": "https://arcgis.racinecounty.com/arcgis/rest/services/2035LandUsePlans/VillageofMtPleasant_2035LandUsePlan/MapServer/0"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "GeoJSON", "format": "GeoJSON", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "accessURL": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8f24647e8c34487289dcdbe411bb769c_0.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A6609%2C%22wkid%22%3A103191%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "CSV", "format": "CSV", "mediaType": "text/csv", "accessURL": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8f24647e8c34487289dcdbe411bb769c_0.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A6609%2C%22wkid%22%3A103191%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "KML", "format": "KML", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "accessURL": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8f24647e8c34487289dcdbe411bb769c_0.kml?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A6609%2C%22wkid%22%3A103191%7D"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Shapefile", "format": "ZIP", "mediaType": "application/zip", "accessURL": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8f24647e8c34487289dcdbe411bb769c_0.zip?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A6609%2C%22wkid%22%3A103191%7D"}], "spatial": "-87.9563,42.67,-87.8922,42.756", "theme": ["geospatial"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "identifier": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/73e98d144603416999f090db202b6ddc_0", "license": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/73e98d144603416999f090db202b6ddc_0/license.json", "landingPage": "https://data-racinecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/73e98d144603416999f090db202b6ddc_0", "title": "Town of Burlington 2035 Planned Urban Service Area Boundary", "description": "<div>****Converted to NAD83(2011) by ProWest &amp; Associates Inc in January of 2019.<br /></div>&quot;The year 2035 regional land use plan incorporates the basic principles and concepts of the previously adopted plans.
